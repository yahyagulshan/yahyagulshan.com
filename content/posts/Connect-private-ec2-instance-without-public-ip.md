* Choose the EC2 Instance Connect tab.

* For Connection type, choose Connect using EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint.

* For User name, verify the user name.

* For Max tunnel duration (seconds), enter the maximum allowed duration for the SSH connection.

* The duration must comply with the maxTunnelDuration condition specified in the IAM policy. If you don't have access to the IAM policy, ask your administrator to verify it. If maxTunnelDuration is not specified in the IAM policy, enter the default, which is 3600 seconds (1 hour).

* For EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint, choose the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint in the instance‚Äôs VPC.

* Choose Connect to open a terminal window.

### Connect to your Linux instance using SSH üíª

**Single connection**

* To allow only a single connection to an instance using SSH and the open-tunnel command

      ssh -i my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@i-0123456789example \
      -o ProxyCommand='aws ec2-instance-connect open-tunnel --instance-id i-0123456789example'

* For:

* -i ‚Äì Specify the key pair that was used to launch the instance.

* ec2-user@i-0123456789example ‚Äì Specify the username of the AMI that was used to launch the instance, and the instance ID.

* --instance-id ‚Äì Specify the ID of the instance to connect to. Alternatively, specify %h, which extracts the instance ID from the user.

**Multi-connection**

* 1- Run the following command to start listening for new TCP connections on the specified port on your local machine.

      aws ec2-instance-connect open-tunnel \
      --instance-id i-0123456789example \
      --local-port 8888

üëá: Expected output  üëá  

    Listening for connections on port 8888.

* In a new terminal window, run the following ssh command to create a new TCP connection and a private  tunnel to your instance.

      ssh -i my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@localhost -p 8888


üëá: Expected output  üëá

    Accepted new tcp connection, opening websocket tunnel.
